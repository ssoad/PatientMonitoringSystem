# Smart Patient Monitoring System

## Motivation:
<p>Every year in our high dense populated country lots of patients are admitted to
hospitals for medical treatment but unfortunately for the shortage of doctors and
nurses monitoring many patients don&#39;t get proper treatment. A smart patient
monitoring system can reduce this problem and can undoubtedly save a more
valuable life.</p><br>

## Objective:
<p>The objective of patient monitoring is to have a quantitative assessment of the
important physiological variables of the patients during critical periods of their
biological functions. For diagnostic and research purposes, it is necessary to
know their actual value or trend of change. It also reduces health care costs by
reducing physician office visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic testing
procedures, and time-saving.</p><br>

## Critical Challenges:
<p>As our background is not from medical science so it&#39;s
obviously tough for us to work with this project where the most critical
challenge is doing this type of sensitive project having a very low level of
knowledge about medical science and one small error or miscalculation can
create a massive accident. So the challenge is much critical.</p>

## Technolgy Used:

 - Python, Django, Django REST API (Backend)
 - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ChartJS (Frontend)
 - Arduino UNO, Proteus (For Hardware Simulation)
 - Github (VCS)
